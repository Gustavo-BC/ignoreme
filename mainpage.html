					<h3>History</h3>
						
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Games Flute Ensemble was founded in 2015 by a group of flutists who shared a
						<em>passion</em> for video game music while studying various music degrees at the New World School of the Arts.
						With the combine knowledge and the spirit of the saying <strong>"ggs"</strong> during matches in games, the group was made.
						After the formation of the group, the ensemble started performing arrangements of different video game music compositions. 
						Eventually, more flutists were curious about the group and the ensemble had an idea of having a meeting where all flutists
						can come together and talk, practice, and perform video game music. Now with over 30 active members, the ensemble has
						become a source of music in video game content.</p><br>

					<h3>Objective</h3>
						
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a space in the music community to explore the wonderful compositions of
						video game music and have flutists gather and perform, practice, and talk among other
						flutists about anything related to the games that we grew up with or
						left an impression on us recently.</p><br>
